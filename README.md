# Chat_App

This a chat app using firebase as the database.

# Inspiration

I need to explore more database options to use and building a chat app is good practice to understanding CRUD operations. (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)

Though we can not delete or edit/update a post at the moment, we still demonstrate a successful create and read operations.

# Usage

<div>
    <p>
        First sign in using your google account. Then you will have access to the chat!
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <a href="https://chat-app-a9849.firebaseapp.com/">
        Click here to visit my app!
    </a>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <img src="./public/images/chat-app.png" alt="" width="300" height="300"/>
</div>
